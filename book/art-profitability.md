# The Art of Profitability

1.  Customer solutions profit

    The case study compares two companies selling financial information. The better
    company assigns two workers to embed in the company for several months to learn
    the customer business entirely.

    > Invest time and energy in learning all there is to know about your customers.
    > Then use that knowledge to create specific solutions for *them*. Lose money
    > for a short time. Make money for a long time.

2.  Pyramid profit

The case study highlights Mattel's pyramid of Barbie dolls. The cheap $10 Barbie
dolls form the lower steps and the $200 Barbie dolls adorn the top.

> A true pyramid is a system in which the lower-priced products are 
> manufactured and sold with so much efficiency that it's virtually impossible
> for a competitor to steal market share by underpricing you.
