# Notes on *The Art of Profitability*

*The Art of Profitability* is a tour through the mentorship of an accountant in
ho-hum telecom firm as he learns different models for business profitability
from his eccentric mentor Zhao. [^@slywotzky2002art] 

### 1. Customer solutions profit

The case study compares two companies selling financial information. The better
company assigns two workers to embed in the company for several months to learn
the customer business entirely.

> Invest time and energy in learning all there is to know about your customers.
> Then use that knowledge to create specific solutions for *them*. Lose money
> for a short time. Make money for a long time.

### 2. Pyramid profit

The case study highlights Mattel's pyramid of Barbie dolls. The cheap $10 Barbie
dolls form the lower steps and the $200 Barbie dolls adorn the top.

> A true pyramid is a system in which the lower-priced products are 
> manufactured and sold with so much efficiency that it's virtually impossible
> for a competitor to steal market share by underpricing you.

### 3. Multi-component profit

The price sensitivity of a customer depends on their context. A customer at a
restaurant is willing to pay 20 cents per ounce of Coke. In a grocery store, the
same customer is only willing to pay 2 cents per ounce. Multi-component profit
views a business as a series of price-differentiated components with wildly 
different profitability.

CAPTION: The model of a business divided into multiple components where each
component targets similar customers at different price points.

The chapter ends with a warning from Zhao about the telecom business focus on 
well-made, inexpensive telecom equipment instead of focusing on the first profit 
model, customer solutions profit: "It's very hard to keep making money, let 
alone grow, once you've allowed yourself to be boxed into a no-profit zone."

As a real-world example, the CEO of Drop (formerly Massdrop), explains how their
largest revenue business component, selling third-party products for a discount.
The decision to shut down the third-party sales was especially difficult because
all of the key performance indicators were outstanding. The long-term trouble
was that the unit economics was awful and the profit margin hadn't improved in 
the years since introducing the third-party product business component. The CEO,
Steve El-Hage, said: "Our long-term value prop for the third-party products was 
built on price, which is very fragile and fleeting value prop."

Interestingly, El-Hage's analysis matches the fictional mentor's analysis of the
flailing telecom company. Zhao warned that "it's remarkable how quickly a 
structure can crumble once cracks appear in the foundation." Both Zhao and 
El-Hage warn against competing in low-margin businesses where competition 
quickly devolves into a race to the bottom. El-Hage instead focused the company
on building high-quality boutique products by partnering a vibrant community
directly with manufacturers.
