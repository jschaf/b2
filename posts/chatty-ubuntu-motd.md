# Cutting down the Ubuntu MOTD down to size

The Ubuntu message of the day (MOTD) is a chatty affair. A [MOTD][motd-wiki]
sends information to all users on login---A recent login message greeted me with
42 lines of questionable value.

## Disable the verbose parts of the message

The commands listed below reduce the verbosity of the MOTD from 42 lines to 11
lines.

```shell script
# Disable cron job that updates the Ubuntu news.
systemctl disable motd-news.timer

# Disable Ubuntu news.
sed -i -e 's/ENABLED=1/ENABLED=0/' /etc/default/motd-news

# Disable MOTD scripts by removing the executable bit so run-parts won't run
# them.
chmod -x \
    /etc/update-motd.d/10-help-text \
    /etc/update-motd.d/50-motd-news \
    /etc/update-motd.d/51-cloudguest \
    /etc/update-motd.d/80-livepatch \
    /etc/update-motd.d/91-release-upgrade \
    /etc/update-motd.d/95-hwe-eol \
    /etc/update-motd.d/98-reboot-required

# The legal notice gets appended to the MOTD by PAM. The simplest way
# to drop it from the MOTD is to delete the file.
rm -f /etc/legal

The trimmed message looks like:

## History of the Ubuntu MOTD

I'm not the first to discover the chatty MOTD. The inclusion of ads in the MOTD
briefly outraged Hacker News and caused several bloggers to blog.

The best overview of the mechanics behind the Ubuntu MOTD is by David Kuhl in
the AskUbuntu question: _[How is /etc/motd updated?][how-motd]_ To summarize,
Ubuntu generates the MOTD by combining data from four sources.

1. Scripts run by `run-parts` in `/etc/update.motd/` like `00-header` or
   `10-help-text`.
1. Binaries invoked by `/etc/pam.d/login`.
1. SSH options from `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, namely `PrintLastLog`.
1. The `/etc/legal` file.

For reference, here's the output of the stock scripts in `/etc/update.motd/`.

### Legal text in the MOTD

The MOTD includes legal text in the login message. The simplest way to prevent
it from appearing in the MOTD is to delete the file: `rm /etc/legal`. The file
contains the following text:

```text
The programs included with the Ubuntu system are free software;
the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

Ubuntu comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by
applicable law.
```

motd (Unix)

The **/etc/motd** is a file on Unix-like systems that contains a "message of the
day", used to send a common message to all users in a more efficient manner than
sending them all an e-mail message.

The contents of the file /etc/motd are displayed by the Unix login command after
a successful login, and just before it executes the login shell. Newer unix-like
systems may generate the message dynamically when the host boots or when a user 
logs in.

Disable motd news or (parts of) the dynamic motd on Ubuntu

On Ubuntu 18.04 and up, when you login via SSH you are greeted with some news
via motd (message of the day) that includes advertisements and messages from
Canonical (via motd.ubuntu.com). This small guide shows you how to disable news,
(parts of) the dynamic motd or just revert back to a plain old /etc/motd file.

How To Disable Ads In Terminal Welcome Message In Ubuntu Server

If you’re using any latest Ubuntu server edition, you might have noticed some
promotional links in welcome message which are not relevant to Ubuntu server
platform. [...] However, there some additional links started to appear in the
terminal welcome message lately.

Ubuntu displays advertising in /etc/motd 

Comment by stinos:

> Instead, https://motd.ubuntu.com should show relevant items to those that use

> users.

Shouldn't that be more like "Instead, Ubuntu should not fetch the motd from the
internet by default, but have this feature as opt-in"?

Comment by matt4077:

Good for them. Ubuntu does lots of good work that benefit the whole community,
and if this allows them to stay in business, and pay people well to write
open-source software, I'm not complaining. Considering the example shown (which
I also get logging in) is about HBO's use of Tensorflow, this also happens to be
the best-targeted ad I've seen in a while. At that level, advertising actually
does become something that's valuable/interesting for the recipient.

And if not, it takes about 10 seconds to disable.

BSD vs. Ubuntu motd(5) 

Comment by jlgaddis:

One implication of this that some people don't realize is that a brand new
Ubuntu instance -- whether a physical host, a virtual machine, an EC2 instance,
whatever -- immediately calls home to Canonical as soon as it spins up for the
first time. The functionality is included in the "base-files" package, which has
a priority of "required" and is marked as an "essential" package. Thus, if you
have an Ubuntu instance, it's nearly 100% guaranteed this is installed and
enabled by default.

Comment by Jonnax:

TBH I find the Ubuntu message of the day quite useful. The "adverts" are benign.
Right now it says to check out microk8s and also to look at livepatch.

How is /etc/motd updated?


It's updated by pam_motd on login. The [update-motd][update-motd-man] manual
page describes this:

[update-motd-man]: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/en/man5/update-motd.5.html

> Ubuntu introduced the update-motd framework, by which the motd(5) is
> dynamically assembled from a collection of scripts at login.
>
> Executable scripts in /etc/update-motd.d/\* are executed by pam_motd(8) as the
> root user at each login, and this information is concatenated in
> /var/run/motd. The order of script execution is determined by the run-
> parts(8) --lsbsysinit option (basically alphabetical order, with a few
> caveats).
>
> On   Ubuntu   systems,  /etc/motd  is  typically  a  symbolic  link  to
> /var/run/motd.
